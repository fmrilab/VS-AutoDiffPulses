## System Requirements:
- Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04
- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8

The implementation was not tested with other configurations.

## General comments

`setup_AutoDiffPulses.m` does the configurations for Matlab.\
For the python part, in your command line, navigate to the repo's root directory, type:

```sh
pip install .
```

Demos are provided in `./demo`.

This repo has included binary test data files for basic accessibility in certain regions.\
Future binary data files will be added to: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EyKhA_d74OC4KADMuTd1kRTEMoVqWdIY>.
